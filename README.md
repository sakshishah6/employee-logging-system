# Employee Logging System

Introducing our new employee time management app!

Our app is designed to streamline the process of tracking employee hours and shifts for both employees and managers. With our app, employees can log their hours, view their shift and break history, and punch in and out of shifts and breaks. This makes it easy for employees to keep track of their hours and ensure that they are accurately recorded.

For managers, our app provides a powerful tool to track employee hours and performance. They can easily view employee history and approve or decline employee hours. This makes it easy for managers to ensure that employees are working the right number of hours and getting paid correctly.

Our app is user-friendly and intuitive, with an easy-to-use interface that makes it easy for both employees and managers to use. With our app, you can say goodbye to the hassle of manual time tracking and enjoy a more efficient and accurate way to manage employee hours and shifts.
